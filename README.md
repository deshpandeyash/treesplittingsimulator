# Multipacket Tree Resolution

This plans to simulate K-Multpiacket reception with succesive interference cancellation. 

The documentation will be updated when work on the K- Multipacket with SIC algorithm will begin.

For current code use, simple tree and modified tree simualtions can be done. 

For direct execution of the simulations with all parameters pre loaded, comment and uncomment the methods in the main in simstudy.py and run the script. You can change basic parameters in simparam.py.
